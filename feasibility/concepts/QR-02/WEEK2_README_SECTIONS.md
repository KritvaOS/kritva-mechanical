# QR-02 — README section updates for Week 2

Apply only numbered sections 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 in the existing concept README. Preserve all other sections, IDs, artwork references and version history. Review the diff before committing.

## 11. Feasibility Activity

Week 1 reference-study work and Week 2 architecture work are documented in the linked concept files. Week 2 scope is preliminary mechanical configuration, dimensions, joint layout, interfaces and mass assumptions.

- Architecture and configuration: `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Preliminary mechanical assessment, load paths, workspace/stability/stiffness/serviceability questions: `MECHANICAL_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Per-joint torque/speed/ROM/duty/S/M/L fields: `ACTUATOR_ANALYSIS.md`; all unavailable values remain `TBD` pending Week 3 inputs.
- Interface inventory and conceptual Kritva platform space provisions: `INTERFACES.md`.
- Published weight target isolated from unsupported subsystem mass contributions: `MASS_BUDGET.md`.
- Conceptual sketch: `sketches/WEEK2_CONCEPT_SKETCH.svg` (not to scale; not CAD).
- DOF and calculation readiness: `calculations/WEEK2_ARCHITECTURE_CHECKS.md`.
- Source traceability: `references/SOURCE_REGISTER.md`.
- Open questions and qualitative risks: `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

No torque/speed, structural strength, stability, S/M/L compatibility, mass breakdown or cost result is claimed unless a traceable calculation is added. No simulation, bench or physical evidence is claimed. Mechanical HOLD D-003 remains active.

## 14. Current Assessment

**Week 2 state: IN_PROGRESS / NOT_REVIEWED.** The concept's mechanical configuration, available dimensions, joint instances, major assemblies, conceptual interfaces, published mass target and initial mechanical concerns are documented in the linked files. Every artwork quantity remains `CONCEPT_TARGET`; every unsupported joint range, torque, speed, mass contribution, interface dimension and centre-of-mass value remains TBD/UNKNOWN.

Concept-specific configuration: Four-legged robot with a central rigid/modular body and four symmetric three-joint legs. Each leg has hip abduction/adduction, hip flexion/extension and knee flexion/extension. Each leg ends in a replaceable foot pad; alternative feet and optional force-sensing/damping are not baseline selections. A top sensor module is optional. The concept sheet describes optional IMU/cameras; cross-section details differ and remain open.

Open artwork / owner decisions: Confirm intended sensor baseline among IMU, camera/RGB-D or stereo, and whether foot force sensing is included.

The preliminary mechanical assessment is qualitative. No strength, stiffness, stability, gait, workspace, collision, actuator compatibility or budget compliance has been proven.

| Major assemblies and conceptual interfaces | IMPLEMENTED IN OVERLAY; not released | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INTERFACES.md` |
| Preliminary mechanical assessment | IMPLEMENTED QUALITATIVELY; calculations incomplete | `MECHANICAL_ANALYSIS.md` |

| CP2 contribution | DRAFTED for INTERN-01 concept only | `feasibility/interns/INTERN-01/CP2_CONTRIBUTION.md` |
| Week 3 torque/speed, structure, stability, mass and cost calculations | NOT STARTED / TBD | Requires source inputs and Week 3 work |
| Owner/reviewer acceptance | NOT RUN | Requires review against exact repository commit |

## 16. Open Decisions

See `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` for the full concept-specific decision and dependency register. Key unresolved items:

- **OWNER_DECISION:** Confirm intended sensor baseline among IMU, camera/RGB-D or stereo, and whether foot force sensing is included.
- **TBD:** Define link lengths, joint offsets/frames, joint ranges, nominal body pose, foot positions and ground clearance.
- **UNKNOWN:** Representative standing, lifted-leg and simple walking support poses; stride, terrain, payload position, speed and duty cycle.
- **UNKNOWN:** Ground-contact friction, footpad properties, impact and compliant/damper parameters.
- **UNKNOWN:** Battery capacity/protection/charging and thermal path; battery space is mentioned in concept sheet but not drawn on cross-section.
- **UNKNOWN:** Actuator variant mass/envelope/mounting and source revision for each joint.

All joint ROM, coordinate frames, torque, speed, duty cycle, actuator S/M/L mapping, interface datums/tolerances, subsystem masses, centre of mass, component costs and any unreported geometry remain TBD/UNKNOWN. These are not silently replaced with assumed values. D-003 remains active.
